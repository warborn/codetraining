## Project

Codewars-like platform built with Ruby on Rails based on  the [codewars-runner-cli](https://github.com/codewars/codewars-runner-cli/tree/master).

This project was created with the intention of developing a complex web application that uses the following technologies:

* Docker
* Ruby on Rails
* Webpack
* In-app code editor

I worked on it in **2017** while I was a student, here's a [presentation](https://slides.com/warborn/codetraining) that demonstrates the features.
